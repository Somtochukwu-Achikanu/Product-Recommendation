# Product Recommendation System

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a product recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to recommend products to users based on their historical preferences and behavior.

## Recommendation algorithms

* Collaborative Filtering: Recommends products based on user similarity and preferences.
* Content-Based Filtering: Recommends products based on features and attributes of the products themselves.
* Hybrid Approaches: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering for improved recommendations.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the recommendation system is available at [Data link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-product-recommendation/overview).


## Fork the repository:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/gbiamgaurav/Product-Recommendation.git


cd product-recommendation


pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Example Notebooks
* Collaborative Filtering Example: Demonstrates collaborative filtering for product recommendations.
* Content-Based Filtering Example: Shows how to use content-based filtering techniques.
* Hybrid Approach Example: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering.
